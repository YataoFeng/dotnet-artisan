## Why?

| Problem | Without this plugin | With this plugin |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Dead/commercial packages | Swashbuckle (unmaintained), FluentValidation (no AOT), MediatR (commercial) | `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`, `AddValidation()`, direct handlers — built-in, free, AOT-safe |
| Anti-patterns | Wraps DbContext in useless IRepository/IUnitOfWork | Injects DbContext directly. EF Core IS the repository. |
| Frozen knowledge | Doesn't know .NET 10: `HybridCache`, file-based apps, `field` keyword | Detects .NET 8–11 automatically, adapts guidance per version |
| Jumps to code | "Build me an order system" → scaffolds wrong assumptions | Completes 7-item checklist, captures domain glossary, picks architecture, then builds |
| Lost context | Disconnect → reconnect → AI has no idea what you built | 30-second rule: every file is self-documenting. AI re-understands instantly |
| Vague debugging | "My app crashed" → generic advice | Opens .dmp in WinDbg, `!analyze -v`, traces to exact line |

## What can it do?

### Build Something New

"Create a customer order Web API"
→ AI asks: order type? flow? .NET version? database?
→ Picks architecture (single/VSA/DDD/Clean) → scaffolds
→ EF Core + Minimal API + auth + OpenAPI + Scalar
→ Integration tests (Testcontainers + real PostgreSQL)
→ Every file self-documenting

Blazor dashboards, CLI tools, gRPC services, AI features (MCP/Semantic Kernel/RAG) — same flow.

### Fix Something Broken

"Production OutOfMemoryException" → debug specialist → WinDbg `!dumpheap -stat` → 850MB byte[] held by ImageCache singleton → reports root cause + fix

Deadlock detection (!dlk, !syncblk), build error diagnostics, race condition analysis — all covered.

### Review and Improve

"Review this PR" → multi-dimensional (correctness/perf/security/architecture) → categorized findings + fixes
"Is this secure?" → OWASP audit (read-only)
"Clean this up" → 7-step pipeline: format → warnings → dead code → CancellationToken
"How should I structure this?" → architect recommends patterns based on complexity

### Test

Unit (xUnit v3) · Integration (Testcontainers) · E2E (Playwright) · BDD (Reqnroll + lightweight xUnit) · Benchmarks (BenchmarkDotNet)

### Ship

Git workflow (branching + Conventional Commits) · CI/CD pipelines · Docker · Cloud (Aspire/AKS) · NuGet · Full PR lifecycle (create→review→merge→release)

### Level Up

.NET migration (8→9→10→11) · Native AOT · Pattern learning from corrections · Parallel workflow optimization

## Who Does What?

Two gateways auto-activate when the plugin is installed:

```
You say anything .NET-related
  → using-dotnet (intent: "Is this .NET?")
  → dotnet-advisor (THE DECISION-MAKER: reads your project files, detects version, analyzes intent, routes to skills, asks if unsure)
  → Domain skills + dotnet-csharp (baseline, always loaded) + optional specialist agents
```

### Skills (14)

## Self-Documenting Code (30-Second Rule)

Every generated project follows one rule: **a fresh AI must understand it in 30 seconds.**

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|-----|-------|
| Solution at root | `OrderManagement.slnx` visible | Hidden in `/src/` |
| Domain project names | `OrderManagement.Api` | `Core`, `Shared`, `Services` |
| One-line file headers | `// Handles fulfillment: validates payment, reserves inventory, creates shipment` | `// Order handler` |
| Explicit dependencies | `constructor(AppDbContext, IHybridCache, TimeProvider)` | `IServiceProvider.GetService<T>()` |
| WHY comments only | `// IServiceScopeFactory: BackgroundService outlives Scoped DbContext` | `// Saves the order` |
| No generic names | — | `Helper`, `Manager`, `Utils`, `Common` |

## Install

```bash
claude plugins install YataoFeng/dotnet-artisan
```

Compatible with GitHub Copilot, VS Code, Cursor. [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard.

Install and done. Open a .NET project → Harness auto-detects → skills load → decision-maker activates. **[→ How harness works](harness/README.md)**

---

## Core Principles

1. **Exhaust questions before acting** — Complete 7-item checklist before writing code. Any "I don't know" → ask more. [→ USAGE.md](USAGE.md)
2. **KISS first** — Simple CRUD does not need DDD. Match pattern to problem scale.
3. **No Repository wrappers** — DbContext IS the UoW; DbSet IS the repository. Inject directly.
4. **No DateTime.Now** — `TimeProvider` everywhere. Injectable, testable.
5. **No commercial packages** — Free/open-source only. MediatR→Mediator(MIT), AutoMapper→Mapperly.
6. **Self-documenting code** — 30-second rule. [→ SELF_DOCUMENTING.md](SELF_DOCUMENTING.md)
