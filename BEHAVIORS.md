# Behavior Catalog

Every behavior this repo can perform, organized by **what you want to achieve**, not by skill name. The decision-maker (`dotnet-advisor`) routes your intent to the right behavior automatically.

## The Decision-Maker

Before any behavior executes, two gateway skills bridge the gap between your words and the right action:

| Role | Skill | What It Does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Intent Detector** | `using-dotnet` | Detects .NET requests from keywords + repo signals. Always runs first. |
| **Decision-Maker** | `dotnet-advisor` | Routes your intent to the right skills + agents. Checks your .NET version. Loads coding standards. Disambiguates overlapping needs. |

The decision-maker doesn't just route — it **analyzes**: your prompt, your project files, your .NET version. Then it asks clarifying questions before delegating. You get the right skill, in the right order, for the right .NET version.

## Agent Directory (When Deep Analysis Is Needed)

The decision-maker invokes specialist agents for one-shot deep analysis. Each agent is an independent sub-session:

| Agent | Specialization | Example Trigger |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| `dotnet-architect` | Architecture, framework choice | "How should I structure this?" |
| `dotnet-aspnetcore-specialist` | Middleware, DI, request pipeline | "Is my middleware order correct?" |
| `dotnet-performance-specialist` | Async, profiling, benchmarks | "Why is it slow?", "Design a benchmark" |
| `dotnet-ui-specialist` | Blazor, MAUI, Uno Platform | "Build a Blazor/MAUI/Uno app" |
| `dotnet-code-lifecycle-agent` | Build errors + cleanup pipeline | "Build fails", "Clean this up" |
| `dotnet-cloud-specialist` | Aspire, AKS, cloud deployment | "Deploy to Azure?" |
| `dotnet-code-review-agent` | Correctness, perf, security review | "Review this PR" |
| `dotnet-csharp-concurrency-specialist` | Race conditions, deadlocks, locks | "This crashes under load" |
| `dotnet-docs-generator` | DocFX, Mermaid, XML docs | "Generate documentation" |
| `dotnet-security-reviewer` | OWASP, secrets, crypto | "Is this secure?" |
| `dotnet-testing-specialist` | Test architecture, test data | "How should I test this?" |
| `dotnet-pr-workflow` | PR lifecycle, merge, release tagging | "Create PR", "merge this", "release" |

## Routing Logic

How the decision-maker chooses:

```
Your prompt
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│ using-dotnet     │  Is this .NET? No → stop. Yes → continue.
└──────┬───────────┘
       ▼
┌──────────────────┐
│ dotnet-advisor   │  THE DECISION-MAKER
│                  │
│ 1. Detect .NET   │  Reads .csproj / global.json
│    version       │
│ 2. Load baseline │  Always loads dotnet-csharp
│ 3. Analyze intent│  Matches keywords to behaviors
│ 4. Route         │  Invokes right skills in right order
│ 5. Ask if unsure │  "Did you mean X or Y?"
└──────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
  Domain skills + specialist agents (if needed)
```

**Example routing decisions:**

| You say | Decision-maker thinks | Routes to |
|---------|----------------------|-----------|
| "Create a todo API" | "New project, API, EF Core → dotnet-api + dotnet-tooling" | api + tooling + csharp |
| "My app crashes" | "Debugging needed. Has .dmp? No → ask for dump. Yes → !analyze" | debugging |
| "Review my code" | "Code review request. C# files found → dotnet-code-review-agent" | code-review-agent |
| "Upgrade to .NET 10" | "Migration. Current: net8.0 → upgrade path: 8→9→10" | devops + tooling |
| "Make this faster" | "Performance. Has benchmarks? No → suggest writing. Yes → analyze" | performance-specialist |
| "Deploy this" | "DevOps. Has Dockerfile? No → suggest creating. Yes → CI/CD setup" | devops + cloud-specialist |
